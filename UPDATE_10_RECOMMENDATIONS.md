# ðŸŽ¯ Updated: 10 Career Path Recommendations

## Changes Made (October 28, 2025)

### âœ… Expanded from 3 to 10 Career Recommendations

**What Changed:**
- **Before:** System showed only 3 career recommendations
- **After:** System now shows **10 diverse career path recommendations**

### Implementation Details:

#### 1. **Career Insights Page**
- Updated `num_recommendations=10` (was 3)
- Adjusted comparison chart height to 600px for better visibility
- Added angled labels for role names (better readability with 10 roles)
- Added summary statistics showing:
  - Average salary across all 10 paths
  - Average growth score
  - Number of high-match roles (>50% confidence)

#### 2. **Recommendation Engine Algorithm**
Enhanced diversity by:
- **Top 3 roles from primary category** (your best match)
- **2 roles each from alternative categories** (based on skill overlap)
- Lowered threshold from 0.1 to 0.05 for more variety
- Each role gets slightly adjusted confidence score for ranking

#### 3. **Role Variety per Category**
- Increased from 3 to 5 top roles per category
- Ensures diverse options even within same career category

### How It Works Now:

When you select your skills (e.g., Python, Machine Learning, AWS):

1. **Top 3 Recommendations** - Best matches from primary category
   - Example: ML Engineer, Data Scientist, AI Researcher

2. **Next 7 Recommendations** - Strong alternatives from related categories
   - Cloud ML Engineer (Cloud Infrastructure)
   - Software Engineer (Software Engineering)
   - Data Engineer (Data Engineering)
   - Plus 4 more relevant roles

### User Benefits:

âœ… **More Options** - 10 career paths to explore instead of 3
âœ… **Greater Diversity** - See roles across multiple categories
